## 🔄 Employee Workflow

### 1. Employee Sign-Up & Verification

**Flow:**
1. Employee signs up with phone/email or login credentials
2. System sends OTP to verify identity
3. After OTP verification, employee profile is created with status "Verified"
4. Employee receives sign-in options and can now access dashboard
5. Profile shows as "Active" or other status

**API Endpoints:**
```
POST /api/employee/login/request/              # Request OTP
POST /api/employee/otp/verify/                 # Verify OTP & create/activate profile
POST /api/employee/otp/resend/                 # Resend OTP
POST /api/employee/register/                   # Alternative registration
POST /api/employee/login/                      # Legacy login without OTP
```

**Backend Structure:**
- Model: `EmployeeProfile` with status field
- Model: `OTPVerification` for handling OTP flow
- Views: Employee authentication views with OTP handling

## 🚀 Backend Activation Steps

To activate the employee and admin systems in the backend:

### 1. Navigate to Backend Directory
```bash
cd C:\Users\Oppen\OneDrive\Desktop\Backend\Backend_TGRWA_DiracAI
```

### 2. Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
venv311\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Check/Create Models
Ensure these models exist in `account/employee_models.py`:
- `EmployeeProfile` - For employee profile data
- `OTPVerification` - For OTP verification flow
- `LeaveRequest` - For leave management
- `OvertimeRequest` - For overtime management
- `EmployeeDocument` - For document management

### 4. Create Serializers
Ensure serializers exist in `account/employee_serializers.py`:
- `EmployeeProfileSerializer`
- `LeaveRequestSerializer`
- `OvertimeRequestSerializer`
- `EmployeeDocumentSerializer`

### 5. Create ViewSets/Views
Ensure views exist in `account/employee_views.py`:
- `EmployeeLoginRequestView` - OTP request
- `EmployeeOTPVerifyView` - OTP verification
- `EmployeeLoginView` - Direct login
- `LeaveRequestViewSet` - CRUD for leaves
- `OvertimeRequestViewSet` - CRUD for overtime
- `EmployeeDocumentViewSet` - CRUD for documents

### 6. Update URLs
Ensure routes are configured in `account/employee_urls.py` and main `urls.py`

### 7. Run Migrations
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 8. Restart Backend Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

---

## 📋 Frontend Environment Setup

### 1. Environment Variables
Ensure `.env.local` or next.config includes:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### 2. Authentication Context
Uses `AuthContext` from `context/AuthContext.js`:
- Manages JWT tokens
- Provides user information
- Handles login/logout

### 3. API Configuration
Uses `lib/config.js`:
- `API_URL` points to backend
- Add auth headers via `useAuth` hook

## 📝 Notes

1. **Word Count Validation**: Overtime descriptions are validated client-side (max 500 words each field). Backend should also validate.

2. **File Upload**: Documents support PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, PNG. Backend should validate file types and sizes.

3. **File Preview**: Only images and PDFs can be previewed inline. Other files show download button only.

4. **Rejection Workflow**: Once rejected, admin must see the rejection reason. Employees cannot override admin decisions.

5. **Leave Balance**: Should be fetched from backend and displayed in:
   - Employee dashboard summary tab
   - Leave details page
   - Leave request form (for reference)

6. **Extra Pay Calculation**: Admin manually enters extra pay amount during approval. Consider backend helper function to calculate based on hourly rate.

7. **Timeline**: All requests show creation and review timestamps automatically.

8. **Email Notifications**: Consider adding:
   - Approval/rejection emails to employees
   - New request notifications to admin
